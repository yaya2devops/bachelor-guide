During all this, I was never the smartest kid.

- There were kids who knew nothing but school.
- There were kids who knew everything but school.
- And then there was me who knew the needed from both.

I expected not that such a system would set me up for life.

- I never studied that hard during my teen years.
- I was just concerned about passing to the next level with my fellows.

And that's exactly what I've done, pushing to the next year so I can bet on other things that the masses are not aware of.

- I expected it to be okay for the greater good.
- That's why I came up with this innovative guide.

That's something you can't find, even if you attend classes day and night.

This comes from pure experience gained from many areas of my life.

And I am here to gift it you all.
