## 📖 Algebra
Algebra is  essential tool for resolving mathematical issues. It enables us to discover connections between things and gain a deeper understanding of the environment. 


- Polynomial fraction
- Rational fraction
- Vector Space 
- Linear Map   

Physics, engineering, and even economics all use algebra in some capacity.



## 📖 Analysis
Math analysis is a critical part in information technologies. The ability to analyze data and find patterns is key for developing new software and applications.

- Limit and Continuity 
- Derivation

Without analysis, it would be difficult to create efficient algorithms or understand how users interact with systems. The mentioned is also used to optimize existing systems and identify security risks.

## 📖 Electricity and Electronics
Electricity is a naturally occurring phenomenon that can be harnessed and used in a variety of ways. It is an important part of our lives, providing power for our homes and businesses.  We rely on electricity to power our lights, appliances, and electronic devices.

- Introduction to Electricity, The history   
- Continuous Electricity    
- Sinusoidal Electricity 
- Sinusoidal Power 
- Transitory Electricity
- Pass Filters: High and Low      
                                 

It also helps us stay connected to the global community by powering the internet and other protocols.

## 📖 Spread And Radiation
Spread and radations allow us to transmit information across vast distances. Without these two phenomena, we would be limited to communicating only with those who are physically near us. 
- Elements of Vector 
- Maxwell's equations 
- Electromagnetic Waves In Vacuum 

We can now connect with anyone in the world instantaneously. 

This has revolutionized how we interact and do business, and has made our world a much smaller place.


## 📖 Operating System
OS provides the foundation to  understand how computers work. 


- Operating system introduction 
- UNIX Foundation Concepts
- Linux Basic Commands
- Layered Architecture & Structure
- Process Scheduling
- Memory management   

The basic concepts of operating systems allow students to troubleshoot problems with their own computers or any system. 

## 📖 Digital electronics

This topic is the foundation of all digital information. 

Computers are based on 0 and 1, can be used to represent any kind of data, making them very versatile.

- Number System 
- Boolean algebra  
- Flip Flops  
- Counters 
- Coder/Decoder 
- Mux/Dmux 
- Add/Sous

This is where you can delve deeper and learn about binary hexadecimal and much more.


## 📖 Algorithms And Data Structure
Algorithms are used to solve problems, while data structures are used to store and organize information. 

The naming can tell the current state of innovation. They provide a way to organize and process information that can be used to create new products or services. By understanding how these tools work, we can better identify opportunities for innovation and create solutions that meet the needs of our society.

- Data structure                  
- Conditional structure           
- Iterative structure             
- Arrays                          
- Registers                       
- Subroutines (Sub program)       
- Sort & Search Algorithm         
- Recursion

Understanding those really helps to identify opportunities for innovation.

Also to create solutions that meet the needs of our society.



## 📖 C Coding Workshop 1
Coding is a great way to improve your problem-solving skills and learn to program machines.  

Meanwhile this semseter, you will learn how to code in C and use it to develop applications.

- IT support                          
- Consolidation  

Most importantly the #1 language for anyone who wants to study or work in a field that uses technology.


I designed this project in english for that matter. <br>Let's get into this together.

## 📖 Communication Techniques
The goal of this subject is to improve your communication skills. You will learn how to articulate yourself better, write professional emails, and become a more effective communicator overall. 

- Organizational communication
- Written Communication    

This subject will benefit you in both your personal and professional life.

> All subjects are equally important 👇
